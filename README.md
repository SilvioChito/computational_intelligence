# Computational Intelligence Course

This repository contains materials and code for the **Computational Intelligence** course.

The course introduces basic principles of computational methods for data processing, including heuristic and trial-and-error approaches. Topics cover local search, evolutionary computation, multi-agent systems, and policy learning, with a focus on handling structured, uncertain, and fuzzy information.
